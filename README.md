# NLP replication files for UNFCCC legal data

The files in this repository are all that I used to do the following:
1) Extract, tokenize and clean official UNFCCC decision texts, from COP22 to COP28
2) Find out the most important issues across UNFCCC and country-submitted data
3) Train a multi-class classifier to then predict what issues are addressed in each document
4) Train a regression model to give each document a score according to the policy position assumed in that document
5) Evaluate both models

The data used in this repository is taken from the official UNFCCC document repository.
